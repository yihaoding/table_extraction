## Pretrained Models  
Mask-RCNN and Faster-RCNN models used by this project were pre-traind on Publaynet Dataset and fine tuning on our datasets. According to your requirements you can selected appropraite pre-traind model based on your demands. The original download links of original IBM provided pre-trained model are provided on below links. Corresponding configuration files can be found on config directory. 
The pre-trained models can be downloaded with the links below
